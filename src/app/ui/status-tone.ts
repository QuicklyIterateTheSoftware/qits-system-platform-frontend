/**
 * What colour a status word is, in one place, for every badge on every page.
 *
 * `QitsBadge` takes a *semantic* tone and never a colour, so this file is a translation between two
 * vocabularies rather than styling. Several docker enums share it — a node's status and
 * availability, a container's state, a task's current and desired state, the swarm's own state —
 * because they overlap and never collide.
 *
 * **The lookup is case-insensitive**, and that is not tidiness. Docker spells the same idea in two
 * cases depending on which command answered: `docker node ls` says `Ready`, `docker ps` says
 * `running`, and a task's desired state is `Running`. One map, keyed in upper case, is what stops
 * the same word rendering grey on one page and green on the next.
 *
 * **PAUSE and DRAIN are warnings, not failures.** An operator put the node there deliberately; the
 * badge says "this node is not taking work", which is exactly what the reader needs to see before
 * asking why a service has fewer replicas than it wants.
