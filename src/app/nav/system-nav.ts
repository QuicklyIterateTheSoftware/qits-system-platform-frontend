 * link, or pressing back, must leave the menu showing the view actually on screen. That is also why
 * the match is a function of the URL and not `routerLinkActive` — `/` would otherwise be active on
 * every page, since every path starts with it.
 *
 * <p>Declared by the shell, not by a page: `RouterOutlet` destroys the outgoing component after
 * creating the incoming one, so a declaration inside a page would be torn down and rebuilt on every
 * hop, in a menu that did not itself change.
