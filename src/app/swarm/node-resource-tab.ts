/**
 * What the four resource tabs of a node share: the id out of the parent route, one read, and the
 * one answer none of them is allowed to draw as an error.
 *
 * **`NODE_REMOTE` is not a failure.** A node-scoped read for a machine this service does not run on
 * answers 409 with that code, and it means "v1 does not reach there" — a fact about this platform,
 * not about the node. Drawn as a red bar it would send an operator looking for an outage; drawn as
 * a card it explains itself and the reader moves on. Every tab therefore renders `remote()` ahead
 * of everything else, and the load state is left idle so the shared error bar stays silent.
 *
 * A base class rather than one generic component, because the four tabs differ only in their
 * columns — and a component that took its columns as data would be a table framework nobody asked
 * for. The read and the template are the subclass's; everything else is here.
