/**
 * What qits-platform-system answers, spelled as the pinned contract spells it
 * (`qits-system-plan.md`, "API").
 *
 * **The reads are bare JSON, not envelopes.** The contract writes `GET /swarm/nodes → [NodeSummary]`,
 * so an array is what arrives and an array is what this app parses. Several sibling explorers unwrap
 * a `{items: […]}` wrapper; this one does not, and a service that grew one would break these pages
 * silently — which is why the API spec asserts the shape rather than trusting it.
 *
 * **Wire names are camelCase**, not docker's `PascalCase`. The service reads
 * `docker … --format '{{json .}}'` and translates; nothing in this app ever sees docker's own field
 * names, so a change in how docker spells a field is the service's problem alone.
 *
 * **Every enum is a plain string, not a union.** Docker adds status words without asking, and a
 * union would only move the surprise from the screen to the compiler on the day it happens.
 * `ui/status-tone.ts` colours a word it has not been taught grey and moves on.
 *
 * **A field this app can live without is optional.** Everything the tables actually draw is
 * required; the extras a detail page merely embellishes with are not, so a service that has not
 * grown one yet renders an em dash rather than `undefined`.
