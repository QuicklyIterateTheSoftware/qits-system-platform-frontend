/**
 * Four providers, in the order spa-home documents and every sibling explorer repeats.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries this app's state: every level of it is a path segment, so each screen
 *   is bookmarkable and the back button works with no code.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the edge, and
 *   none of them is anonymous: the edge's session is what authenticates them, and it does so with
 *   cookies a same-origin request sends by default. The terminal socket rides the same session, for
 *   the same reason — a `WebSocket` cannot carry an Authorization header.
 * - `provideQitsNavigation` gives `QitsMainLayout` its left navigation, by asking the gateway for
 *   `/main-navigation` once at startup. The list is the gateway's answer — derived from the routes
 *   it actually serves — not a list compiled into @qits/ui-components; without this provider the
 *   chrome renders no links at all. It needs the `provideHttpClient` above.
