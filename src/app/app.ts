/**
 * The shell: an outlet, and this application's own menu offered to the chrome.
 *
 * The chrome these pages are seen through — the sidebar, the top bar, the links out to the other
 * SPAs — is `QitsMainLayout` behind the `''` route (see app.routes.ts), so it survives navigation
 * rather than being rebuilt here.
 *
 * <p><b>The sub-menu is declared here and rendered somewhere else, and that is the only arrangement
 * available.</b> `QitsMainLayout` is a route component — the pages are inside *its* outlet and this
 * shell is outside it — so nothing can be projected upwards into the sidebar. The template is
 * handed over instead, and the layout renders it under this application's navigation entry.
 *
 * <p>The shell rather than a page, and that part is a correctness one: `RouterOutlet` destroys the
 * outgoing component after creating the incoming one, so a declaration inside a page would be torn
 * down and rebuilt on every hop — and the menu would flicker on a navigation that did not change it.
