/**
 * Every address of this app, all of them inside the platform chrome.
 *
 * **`QitsMainLayout` is the root route component** — the platform's convention, stated in the
 * component's own docs. Mounted this way the bar and the navigation mount once and survive every
 * navigation beneath them; wrapping each page in a tag would rebuild the whole skeleton on every
 * hop. It is an eager import for that reason: it is not a page, it is the frame the pages arrive
 * in, and a frame that loaded in its own chunk would show a blank application while it did.
 *
 * The pages themselves arrive as this repository grows them; the frame and the 404 come first.
